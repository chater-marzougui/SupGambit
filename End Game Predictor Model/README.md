## ðŸ¤– AI Model: Bidirectional GRU

The AI component of the project features a **Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** model, ideal for sequential data. 

### Model Highlights
1. **Input Layer**: Processes the game state sequence.
2. **Bi-directional GRU Layers**: Captures dependencies in both forward and backward directions.
3. **Dense Layers**: Output probabilities for game outcomes.

### Training Metrics
